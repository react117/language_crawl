"1,874,427",American Gut,,,,,"The American Gut Project is a part of the Microsetta Initiative , with the mission of
    collecting microbiome samples and rich phenotypic data from
    populations across the globe. The Human Microbiome Project and other microbiome projects
    worldwide have laid an important foundation for understanding the
    trillions of microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on
    health and disease. However, opportunities for the public to get
    involved in such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives
    you an opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s
    living on and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange
    for your participation, we generate a report summarizing the types
    of microbes observed in your sample, and how your sample relates to
    other people in the study. While American Gut mainly focuses on the gut as this is where
    most of our microbes reside, we will also look at areas like the
    oral and skin, as these areas of the body also contain microorganisms. Some examples of what we have found using our data: Younger
  children tend to have more proteobacteria composing their microbiome.
   As you grow older, the diversity of your microbiome increases. (Based off our preliminary findings in 2014,
      found here ) There’s a significant difference between the types of bacteria
    found in industrialized populations vs. non-industrialized populations. McDonald et al. mSystems . May 2018. DOI: 10.1128/mSystems.00031-18 If You Live in the U.S.: Joining is
    simple! Select the kit you would like from the list of options on
    the right-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” (if you would like
    to receive a certain number of kits that isn’t listed as a perk,
    email us at info@americangut.org ) . Your kit
    will arrive via USPS within 2 weeks after payment, unless you have added the “Priority Shipping”
    perk along with your kit. If You Live in Europe: Visit our sister site, British Gut , to join. If You Live in Australia or Singapore: While we do have sites set up in Australia and Singapore (known
    as Australian Gut and Asian Gut respectively), we ask that participants contribute an additional $25 on top
    of their contribution, which covers an international shipping fee . These sites allow participants to send their samples back to a
    local site, which then sends the samples back to our lab in the U.S.
    to reduce the costs of shipping. If you live in Australia or Singapore and would like to
    participate, claim a perk.  The next page will have an option to
    ""top off"" your contribution with an additional amount,
    which you will use to add in the $25 to mark your kit to go out. I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not be
      sent out until we have received it. Once we have received your transaction, we will forward your
    information to our collaborators. They will then send out a kit to
    you, which you will receive within 3 weeks . Please note that the r eturn time for results will take significantly longer than the
    expected 3 months for Australian/Asian Gut participants. The reason
    is that we have to bulk ship samples on dry ice back to our lab at
    UC San Diego.  This costs thousands of dollars per shipment, so it’s
    only feasible to do once enough samples are ready to ship. If You Live Anywhere
    Else: International participants are also
    welcome to join. The $25 international shipping fee also applies (which you must include in your contribution), along with other regulations . I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not
      be sent out until we have received it. We also ask that samples are shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. The cost of shipping to our lab in the U.S. from some
    locations can be expensive , so it is recommended that you look into the cost of return
    shipping (it is highly suggested to use FedEx as it is more
    reliable). If you are interested in learning the process of our project
    from start to finish, we have a video available here . Each kit contains a sample tube (or more, if ordered), an
    instruction manual on how to register your kit and take a sample,
    credentials to access our participant website, and return
    envelope(s) to send your sample back. Your results will provide a general overview of how your microbial profile
    compares to other participants ( these results are not intended to be medically actionable,
      and we cannot provide any personalized interpretation ). You will also receive a list of the microorganisms found in
    your sample and their relative abundances (based at the genus
    level).  Results are uploaded via our participant website, which you
    will get access to once you register your kit. For stool samples, it will take about 3-4 months for you to receive your results, and longer for those who are
      participating outside the U.S. (due to shipping procedures to send
      samples back to our lab, which is based at the University of
      California San Diego).  It takes approximately significantly
      longer (5+ months) to receive results if you submit one of the
      following sample types: Oral or skin samples . A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome . Note that your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the American Gut Project help
      account ( info@americangut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that the Fundrazr transaction fee will be

"8,325",Please help Matthew!,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,27,"Matthew and his sister Tiffani were born with what is called CVID,
  common variable immunodeficiency.  Both were being treated under a
  Professor,with the medication called Octagam once a month through an
  IV drip.Matthew had an unfortunate experience in the last month, where
  he had a reaction to the Octagam and caused him to end up in hospital
  having lumbar punctures, MRI scans and sonars.  Unfortunately he is
  now unable to receive the Octagam as its a gamble as to whether or not
  he would have the same issues happen again. The option now is to move
  to the subcutaneous medication which is extremely costly. The medical
  aid will cover a portion of this every month, but I am short R5000 per
  month on a 4 week month and R10000 on a 5 week month.  There is also
  the cost of a pump to purchase of over R8000 which medical aid does
  not cover. If I cannot raise enough money, Matthew will not receive
  the correct amount of medication each month, which could lead to more
  infections.  Matthew and I are requesting any form of support no
  matter how big or small that you can give us to help him lead a normal
  healthy life. Thanks to all the local and international kind hearted
  people matt could start his therapy on his correct level for this
  month. It’s been a very trying time for the past two days but my
  little boy has managed to be so brave. I can only thank the support we
  have received, please don’t stop with the support",https://fundrazr.com/11Ko66
"1,100",A medical fund for Meville Family,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,2,"May 29th, Greg Meville (in the black shirt) is our very close family
  friend. He suffered a heart attack and cardiac arrest while out on a
  jog. A Good Samaritan found him, called 911, and initiated CPR. He was
  resuscitated and had a stent put in, but due to lack of oxygen to his
  brain for several minutes he has anoxic brain injury and has a very
  long road to recovery ahead of him in addition to a lot of medical
  bills. In an effort to decrease some of the monetary burden I have
  created this fundraiser to support the Meville family during this
  difficult time. Please donate, if you are able and feel led to, and
  keep Greg and his family in your prayers.",https://fundrazr.com/a1Y3c9
221,Support Needed for The Treatment - Emergency,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,3,"I am Prakash  Dangol, Founder of Care4Nepal,  raising fund for the
  education support of needy children and community support as required.
  This is my next fund raising appeal to support my own brother for his
  treatment. No one can imagine and know how and when the problems come
  in our life…Problems always come suddenly without asking. Same thing
  happened to me and in my brother’s life …His story in brief is here … He has two sons and one daughter. He has been
    sick normally for the past 15 years and now he has been diagnosed
    with Cirrhosis, a disease that results in the failure of the Liver.
    Recently he got admitted to the hospital for Ascites, a condition
    where fluid builds up in the abdomen due to liver failure. The doctors have suggested urgent liver transplant as the
    best option. And the date for operation is fixed for 13th September
    The cost for the transplant and the tests needed are estimated to be
    around USD 25-28k addition to the cost for the medication needed
    after surgery. It’s a big amount to be arranged in such a short
    period. We would appreciate every bit of your help raising some
    money needed to do his transplant surgery.  Every contribution would
    mean a lot to us and would be very thankful for your heeling and
    helping hands.",https://fundrazr.com/d1YFcd
"32,330",Urgent Support Needed for Tony Dowling's Cancer Journey!,Australian Dollar,,of $60k goal,92,"Hi, my names Matt my wife and I have been friends with Tony and Tracy for nearly twenty
    years. They are a beautiful family and it was such a shock when I
    got the call from Tony recently telling me of his cancer diagnosis! I’m sure most of you have been following his journey as we have
    and are sending a constant stream of love, positive thoughts and
    prayers their way. I spoke again with Tony last week and heard the n ews of
    the new diagnosis and upgrade from stage 1 to stage 4. Truly heartbreaking to hear, but Tony is as positive and
    faith-filled as always, a true inspiration, we stand strong with
    them believing for a full recovery! He told me briefly of some of the struggles of dealing with the
    unexpected expenses and also the obvious loss of income etc. but
    expressed that he knows that God has it all under control and that he is confident of a positive outcome. After our chat I got off the phone and probably like many of you
    who are not physically located near Tony and Tracy in Sydney
    Australia, I thought to myself, there has to be something we can do to help, so I have set up this campaign in
    the hope that you will all join us in standing together to help make
    a massive difference to Tonys journey! Following is a snapshot of the Dowling family, a link to Tony’s
    journey so far which you can follow and the reasons why our
    donations are so very vital and impactful at this time for them... Tony is 46 years old and has been married to
  Tracy for 19 yrs. They live on the northern beaches of Sydney with
  their two boys Max 16 and Noah 14. The family is heavily involved in
  local basketball through the boy's school and the Manly representative
  level comps. Tracy is involved at the boy's school and helps
  co-ordinate and manage multiple basketball teams. Tony has a background as a school teacher,
  business entrepreneur and currently works in training and software
  development. They are active members of the local community, and
  church and love travelling, family time and adventures of any kind. Tony and Tracy have impacted the lives of so many people around the
  globe and locally with their big hearts and generous souls. We all have been positively influenced by this amazing couple in some
  shape or form, through either school, community, business or church
    life. Here is a link where you can follow Tony’s journey and progress: https://www.mylifeline.org/invitation/FOTY/b53c54fcc2abfed6f3d977439df0c4c309e98f36fff675b0772a480f52894be2 How we can help: Tony has just had surgery to remove bowel cancer which has also
  spread to his right lung. Tony’s diagnosis has now jumped from stage 1 to stage 4! This means that it is full steam ahead for aggressive chemotherapy
  treatment for the next 6 mths, followed by lung surgery around
  November 2019. They are in the process of trying to access some insurance funds, but
  there is a 3 mth waiting period that is not covered and then funds
  will still only cover 3/4 of normal income. On top of that, there are all the additional medical bills, hospital
  expenses, gap payments, medications and day to day additional expenses
  that come with this type of treatment... We want Tony, Tracy and the boys to be able to focus on the important
  things and keep any additional stress to a minimum. We would like to
  provide enough to get them through this 4 month transition period and
  also give them a buffer so that there is not a financial burden and
  pressure on them over the next 6 months. We would like to enable Tracy to not have to take up any additional
  work to cover any shortfall and added expenses, but be able to spend
  the time with Tony and attend to all the necessary appointments and
  give him all the required care and attention needed at this time. After calculating the amount needed to cover their everyday expenses
  keeping them afloat and to keep life as normal as possible, plus
  enough to help cover their ongoing medical costs for the next 6
  months, we have set a goal to raise $60K. Anything above that will go towards any additional ongoing medical
  expenses and treatment required. We kindly ask you to consider donating to help bless Tony
        and his family at this time as they link arms and stand together
        with friends, and family near and far to fight this nasty thing
        head on! If we all give what we can and share this with our various
        friends and networks then Tony and His family’s journey will be
        made so much easier by us all joining together to show how much
        we care! Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations... God Bless!!",https://fundrazr.com/f1TtQ0
"1,500",Please Help - Leg amputation avoided yet slow healing recovery &many sideffects,U.S. Dollar,,of $14.8k goal,36,"We need urgent help - can you reach out to us? My name is Maria del
  Rocio Garcia, and I have setup this Fundrazer page for my S/O
  (Significant Other/Fiance) Thomas Ernst.  (He is German so there is a
  summary in his language below this English text) For Mexican supporters: Find a summary in Spanish
    here - En español aqui He was hospitalized with a
  aggressive tissue decaying infection in his left leg below the knee
  December 2016 with the initial diagnoses by several doctors to
  amputate the leg above the knee. Dr. Mar Chavira at Salvatierra
  hospital in La Paz did not share that opinion and initiated treatment
  and procedures to rescue the limb and avoid an pending
  amputation. The goal of this fundraising..if met...would cover
  our medical expenses incurred so far (+/-9,500,-US $) as well the cost
  of living / debt accumulated during the time of the illness and
  recovery without any income and would supply the funding required to
  find another rental moving to a better location with option to work
  for him (+/- 5500,-US $) Please read explanation in details further
  down and in the blog we have started. Basically we are not capable on our own power to leave the
  sub-average lifestyle zone we are in right now and funding would
  provide a huge help to Thomas Ernst and me assisting to restart our
  life to a ""normal"", simple lifestyle level again. This
  is basically ""our story"" in a nutshell. Please read in
  detail below and may consider making a donation to allow T.E. to get
  back to work, to manage the significant debt accumulated from his
  battle with the infection. A donation of any kind will be greatly
  appreciated and would be a huge help. Also, please feel free to
  forward on the link to anyone you think might be interested in
  supporting the cause. Please use this contact form If you have
  any questions. Otherwise, thank you for your time and consideration of
  this effort to help Thomas Ernst and
  me. --------------------------------------------------- We
  do not have a professional background to create such fundraiser pages
  as this here in the proper way and writing. My English also has
  severe flaws and I apologize for that. It is work in progress as
  we been forced to change the fundraiser platform due to the
  circumstances that prior used crowdfund Youcaring merged with GoFundMe
  and by their policy is Mexico a Non-GoFundMe supported Country
    and they will shut down. You find info on this here You can see screenshots of received donations during the past 2
  weeks here on our blog . The prior campaign did not generate any support since put online June
  2017 until Maria and a local good Samaritan, Francisco Lopez, reached
  out at the Baja Nomads forum and made the
  situation known at the beginning of May 2018. Them folks made already
  a HUGE impact on our life. Having everyday ""real"" food
  (prior eating for weeks beans & rice or Marushan), all medical
  supplies required and having made some payments to most pressing debt
  collectors, have electricity and communication secured. All this is
  already a big relieve creating some breathing space. Also here
  you find the progress in several sets of images from December 2016 on
  until August 2017 when we had to see phone with camera used. Please be
  aware - some of this images are VERY graphical and not for everybody's
  stomach to view!!! Album - Gallery until August 2017 here on Google documents . We have genuinely tried during the past 18 month to progress yet the
  combination of advancing the healing with ambulant treatment (the
  first 6 month 2-3x per week hospital visits), the cost of medication,
  medical supplies and transportation, basic cost of living - rent,
  electricity, telefon, food was in dimensions to large to cope for us.
  Ernst Thomas has no family or relatives, Maria has a small income from
  a clerical position in a hotel working night-shifts. We have sold any valuables to create funds, we have no vehicle. Ernst
  Thomas was still recovering from the impact hurricane Norbert and
  Odile created 2014. ###################################################################### German Summary - E.T. ist jederzeit bereit mit Ihnen in Deutsch zu kommunizieren und evtl. Fragen zur
  Sachlage zu beantworten! ###################################################################### Mein Name ist Maria del Rocio Garcia, und ich habe diese
    Fundrazer-Seite für meinen Verlobten Thomas Ernst
    eingerichtet. Er wurde mit einer aggressiven
    Gewebeverfall-Infektion in seinem linken Bein unterhalb des Knies im
    Dezember 2016 ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert, wobei mehrere Ärzte
    zunächst das Bein über dem Knie amputierten wollten. Dr. Mar
    Chavira vom Salvatierra-Krankenhaus in La Paz teilte diese Meinung
    nicht und leitete eine Behandlung und Verfahren ein, um das Glied zu
    retten und eine bevorstehende Amputation zu vermeiden. Das Ziel
    dieser Spendenaktion - falls wir es erreichen koennten - wäre unsere
    bisher angefallenen Arztkosten (+/- 9.500, - US $) sowie die während
    der Zeit der Krankheit akkumulierten Lebenshaltungskosten /
    -schulden und die einkommenslose Genesungzeit zu tragen und eine
    Finanzierung bereitstellen, die benötigt wird, um eine andere
    Wohngelegenheit zu finden, die zu einem besseren Standort mit der
    Möglichkeit bewegt, für ihn zu arbeiten (+/- 5500,-US $). Grundsätzlich sind wir nicht in der Lage, die
    unterdurchschnittliche Lebenstil, in der wir uns gerade befinden,
    aus eigener Kraft zu verlassen, und die Finanzierung würde Thomas
    Ernst und mir helfen, unser Leben wieder auf ein
    ""normales"", einfaches Niveau zu bringen. Dies ist im
    Grunde genommen ""unsere Geschichte"". Bitte lesen Sie
    im Detail unten und erwägen Sie möglicherweise eine Spende, um T.E.
    um wieder an die Arbeit zu gehen, um die beträchtlichen Schulden zu
    verwalten, die sich aus seinem Kampf gegen die Infektion angesammelt
    haben. Eine Spende jeglicher Art wird sehr geschätzt und wäre
    eine große Hilfe. Bitte zögern Sie auch nicht, den Link an alle
    weiterzuleiten, von denen Sie glauben, dass sie die Sache
    unterstützen könnten. Bitte benutzen Sie dieses Kontaktformular , wenn

"706,137",British Gut,,,,,"This is a unique, open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The American Gut Project (AGP) / The Microsetta Initiative to expand the study of the bacterial diversity to
    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"".  Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego.  We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at King’s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isn’t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around £2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, we will then sent it to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and
  analyzed. We typically bulk ship samples back to the Knight
  Lab about every 2 months on dry ice to reduce shipping costs. Once
  your sample arrives at the Knight Lab (you'll get a notification when
  they have received your sample), processing takes 3-4
    months. We estimate that the whole process will take about
    4-6 months. Each kit contains a sample collection device (or multiple if you
    ordered more than one), an instruction packet on how to sample, and
    return envelope(s) to send your sample tube(s) back. Once we provide you with your results, you will receive data
    visualization of how your results compare to other people who are
    within the same diet and lifestyle group as you (having different
    results from them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can
    just be that you have different lifestyles that make bacterial
    profile is different).   In addition, you will be provided with a
    list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and their
    relative abundances (based at the genus level). These results are not actionable,
      and we do not provide any personalized interpretation . It will take longer than the expected 4-6 months to receive
      results if you are submitting one of the following sample types: Oral or skin samples. A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome. Note your de-identified information will be part of a

"153,970",Help James McCarthy in his battle against leukemia,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,980,"How you can help: Donate to James’ care: https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay Register to be a bone marrow donor: http://www.bethematch.org/ James’ Story: On Tuesday, August 7th we were leaving the house for Rita’s birthday
  dinner when we received a voicemail from James’ doctor. She said to call immediately and left her personal cell phone
    number. As we walked, James was being his usual self:
  running down Southport Ave and acting like a healthy, happy little
  boy. Forty-eight hours later, James would be in critical
  condition, on a ventilator, and fighting for his life.  Two days after
  that James was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of Leukemia. When we called the doctor back, she shared that a routine blood test
  showed James’ white blood cell count was abnormally high and she
  wanted us to get more tests done by the Leukemia and cancer
  specialists at Lurie’s Children Hospital. To put it in
  perspective, healthy children usually have a white blood cell count of
  5,000 to 10,000. James’ was at 32,000. Thursday was the soonest appointment we could get with a hematologist
  - a doctor who specializes in diseases of the blood. The
  doctors at Lurie’s confirmed that something was not right. They wanted to get a bone marrow sample to figure out what was
  going on and the quickest way to the front of the line was to have
  James admitted. At that point, there wasn’t a high level
  of concern for James’ immediate health. We spent the day
  playing with trucks, reading books, watching “gee” (Curious George)
  and looking at cars, trucks, buses and all his favorite sights of the
  city from the hospital room window. On Friday morning at 9:30 am, James underwent a procedure to extract
  a bone marrow and a bone sample from his hip. The
  doctor’s shared what they were testing for: James likely either had
  Leukemia or an auto-immune disease. Devastation. A few hours later the oncologist (cancer doctor) called us to the
  consultation room for a discussion. She shared what was
  seemingly good news. The initial blood results had ruled
  out the most common types of Leukemia, which typically make up more
  than 99% of annual childhood Leukemia diagnosis. The
  only cancer they couldn’t rule out was a very rare form of Leukemia
  called Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, or JMML. We
  would later learn that JMML is so rare that there are currently only
  20 kids diagnosed in the U.S. While we didn’t yet have an answer for what was affecting James, we
  cautiously celebrated the news since the other options were an auto
  immune disease or pneumonia.  We were told the rest of the tests would
  likely come back on Monday. That night James’ health rapidly deteriorated. His
  temperature spiked to 104. His heart rate was racing at
  200 beats per minute. His lungs began to fail. To help his little body the nurses and doctors put him on
  oxygen and a few IVs. While we were scared – and not
  knowing what was happening – we at least had the benefit of being able
  to talk to the doctors. James didn’t. As the night progressed, the doctor’s wanted to increase his oxygen
  to help with his lungs; and to do so, he needed to be moved to the
  Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and only they could administer
  the higher dosage. For the next 24-hours, James would not rest; his body would not let
    him. Each time he did fall asleep, he would wake up 10
  to 20 minutes later terrified and not knowing what was happening.  His
  body was in overdrive, IVs and sensors all over his body, a tube
  inserted down his nose into his stomach – how could he understand? It was excruciating. His body was being
    overworked. He was having trouble breathing. He was not getting the rest needed. He was
  pleading with all the words he had.  “All done.” “Momma.” “Up.”
  “Outside.” It was heartbreaking and terrifying to watch
  our poor little baby so scared and so sick, feeling completely helpless. The PICU team told us what we could already see.  James’ body
  could not sustain this pace on his own, so we made the decision to
  sedate and intubate him (put on a breathing machine.) It
  was mentally impossible to hear but we knew it had to be done.  We sat
  bedside with James as he was sedated and the breathing tubes inserted
  into his lungs.  This was two days after we walked into the hospital
  with a seemingly healthy little boy. Saturday brought a new bombshell. The only piece of
  good news we had received instantly disappeared. Our
  James had JMML, the rarest type of childhood Leukemia. The doctors now suspected that James did not have pneumonia. Instead it was leukemia filling his little lungs with white
  blood cells. James’ white blood cell count accelerated
  rapidly throughout the day from 30,000 (which we previously thought
  was unimaginably high) to 50,000 to 78,000 to 90,000 to 111,000 to 128,000. Our little James was now in critical condition. Some of
  the best doctors in Chicago were working with him minute-by-minute,
  hour-by-hour to keep him going. Everything had happened
  so fast that we didn’t even have time to process one bit of news
  before we had moved onto another. But we kept in mind
  one thing: if you’ve met James, you know he is a strong-willed little
    toddler. If anyone can battle this, it’s James. While James’ lungs were responding to the breathing machine, it
  wasn’t enough.  The doctors decided to move him to a
  new ventilator that could also administer anesthesia gas in addition
  to breathing for James.  This machine had to be brought up from the
  E.R. and had only been used a few times on the PICU floor over the
  past two years. We were told James may be the sickest
  patient in the hospital (438 patients) and that he was fighting for
  his life. We were grasping for straws. The doctors told us they
  were running out of things to try. We
  discussed unproven options that had never been tried on a patient as
  young as James. We signed consent forms. Fortunately, the new machine began to stabilize James and we took
  some of those options off the table.  During “rounds” the next
  morning we counted thirteen doctors and nurses around James’ room to
  get an update on his condition.  We felt like we were in the right
  place with the right level of attention from an incredibly experienced
  medical staff. We had tremendous support from family and
  friends – all rallying around James and supporting us day and night. On Sunday, August 12th- just 5 days after receiving that urgent
  call from the doctor - James started Chemo. His chemo is
  now administered twice a day. Once for
    30-minutes. Later in the day for 4-hours. He typically also requires a blood transfusion. This is in addition to the 18-25 drips of medication he is on
  every hour. As crazy as it sounds, this is only part of the story over the past
  week. There have been other challenges with blood
  pressure, his lungs filling with carbon dioxide (CO2), scary
  challenges switching him to new medical machinery, but tough little
  James is making progress. On Wednesday the 15th he moved
  to a smaller ventilator. His white blood cells are down
  to 30,000. While still on anesthesia, James has been resting in bed with his
  night time puppy, Curious George stuffed animal and a pacifier in one
  hand and his favorite toy truck in the other. We have
  been reading James books, which is very difficult while keeping your
  emotions in check. James has a long fight in front of him. It’s scary to
  think about all the challenges ahead but right now we are focused on
  today. One step at a time, then we will tackle the next target. Ultimately, the only cure for JMML is a bone marrow transplant, in
  addition to extensive chemotherapy over the coming months until we
  find the appropriate donor match. If you want to see if
  you would be a match for James, please register at the website below. Nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed with Leukemia this year. There are a lot of kids like James out there whose only hope is
  to find a good donor match. You can do it from your own
  home and it’s as easy as swabbing the inside of your cheek. Please visit: http://www.bethematch.org/ You can learn more about JMML at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myelomonocytic_leukemia Please keep James in your thoughts and prayers.  He’s the
  sweetest little boy you’ll ever meet. We can’t wait to
  hear his voice again. To see his kind blue eyes. To have him blow us a kiss with a smile. I love
    you James. You can donate to James’ care at https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay",https://fundrazr.com/f1OA33
250,Help Leewana heal -- get her back in action!,U.S. Dollar,,of $4.5k goal,2,"I must fight with all my strength so that the little positive
      things that my health allows me to do might be pointed toward
      helping the revolution. The only real reason for living. - Frida Kahlo *** Hey there! Wow. I didn’t realize how difficult this would be to write. I
    believe that we strengthen our communities and fight tyranny when we
    lift each other up. But it’s still not easy to admit that while I am
    fortunate and privileged in so many ways, I, Leewana, your friend,
    comrade, and co-conspirator, have a debilitating health condition.
    It’s even harder to add that because I want so desperately to be
    back in the trenches with you, I’m asking for your help. Ack, vulnerability! What’s going on? In case you don’t want to read the whole story... I have been
      suffering from debilitating migraines for the last year and would
      appreciate any help you can offer. You can donate once now, or
      choose a recurring donation that will last ONLY for the next four months . I have
      no preference, it's whatever works for you. If you want more detail, read on! For a little over a year, I’ve had a migraine almost every day. I started getting periodic migraines when I was 13 -- not fun,
    but manageable. Then last May, I flew backwards on a bus and got a
    concussion. My doctors think that it “triggered my pain systems,”
    and are hard at work to identify possible underlying conditions. All I know for sure is that it changed everything. Because migraines aren’t “visible,” it can be easy to diminish
    their impact. But the World Health Organization rates them as the 6th most debilitating health condition overall, and they take top honors among neurological conditions. This is a useful article about
      the full impact of migraine, from mental fuzziness to excruciating pain. For me, some days it’s “just” a headache. Those are among the
    days that I might be able to muster up energy to socialize or go to
    a meeting. But too often, my head throbs, I can’t stand, I feel dizzy,
    I’m nauseous, and all I can do is lie down in a dark room. In my darkest moments, it feels like migraines have completely
    taken over my life, and I doubt whether I’ll be able to do things
    like exercise, work full time, or socialize in groups ever again. I
    don’t think it’s a coincidence that migraines are strongly linked to
    depression and other mood disorders. I’ve become another medical debt sob story. In the initial aftermath of my concussion, I never imagined that
    I would still be in chronic pain over a year later. And when I was
    forced to stop working altogether in January, I had no idea that
    solving my headaches could take this much time, energy, and resources. I’ve tried remedies across the spectrum of Eastern and Western
    medicine, from acupuncture to magnesium to Botox. Unfortunately
    since the scientific community knows so little about migraines, most
    treatment plans are based on trial and error. By committing to put the necessary effort into feeling better,
    I’ve taken on a crippling amount of medical debt. Oh, the places I’d go without migraines holding me back. My medical debt is suffocating. But the hardest part of this
    ordeal is being forced to sit still for days, weeks, and months when
    there is so much work to do. I’m happy when I’m dancing with dear
    friends. I’m happy when I have enough energy to support my loved
    ones like they deserve. I am happiest fighting for a better world alongside all of you. I’ve been fortunate throughout the years to be surrounded by
    inspiring visionaries and doers. Over and over I’ve seen that righteously angry people can hack away at the seemingly inescapable power of the big banks, retail
    giants, a white supremacist government, and anything else they throw
    at us. I never dreamed that I would be forced to take such tremendous
    steps back from my work in the movement , from close friends, and also from many of the simple pleasures
    I enjoy in life. It’s been discouraging, but I am holding out hope
    that I can feel enough like myself again to get back to imagining
    and creating a more hopeful future for all of us. I am DETERMINED to get better. Like Frida, a fellow chronic pain sufferer, I am going to “ fight with all my strength” so that what “my health allows me to
    do might be pointed toward helping the revolution.” I’ve been trying
    to stay engaged in the struggle in small ways, and over the next few
    weeks I’m going to experiment with reconnecting with the work in a
    more part-time capacity. I hope that my contributions can get bigger
    and bigger as I continue treatment. There is some good news… In the past two months, I’ve developed a relationship with a
    leading neurologist and researcher at Mayo Clinic. It’s been refreshing to experience Mayo’s model of integrative
    health, and talk to doctors who can actually give me the time I
    need. With their support, I’m hoping to continue experimenting with
    new and unusual remedies to see what offers relief. Among these are CGRP inhibitor shots, Trigeminal Nerve devices,
    and transcranial magnetic stimulation. It’s too early for me to give
    out too much information without jinxing it… but Mayo doctors may
    have also found an underlying condition making my headaches worse.
    Fingers crossed! And now for the hard part … going beyond typical methods (which
    haven’t worked for me), and visiting top-notch medical institutions
    (when others can’t give me what I need) costs a lot of money. I’m
    lucky to have gotten support from my family, but we are at the end
    of our means. In order to continue down these treatment paths, and
    hopefully ultimately get relief, I need some kind of miracle. That’s why I’m reaching out to my beloved community. Because of insurance compatibility issues, the CGRP-inhibitor
    shot costs $650 per month. A “Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation” or
    “Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation” Device totals around $500, or
    $250 / month, depending on which I use. Continued visits to Mayo
    Clinic cost $400 - $500 each. And as mentioned above, I’ve
    accumulated thousands in medical debt over the last year. I’m not asking to cover my living costs, or even my entire
    medical costs. But any small dent you can help put in this sum,
    which totals from $800 - $1500 per month, is deeply felt. You can either donate in one chunk, or choose the option
        to spread it out over the next 4 months. All donations will go directly towards the medical costs I
    outlined above, or towards paying off prior medical debt. I am
    making it possible to donate on a recurring basis because some
    friends shared that they would like the option to spread out their
    donation over a few months... Do whatever feels best to you! My goal is to use this boost to dive into new treatments,
    and level out my costs as I discover what works. I will keep you
    consistently updated, and you can rescind a donation at any time. Without your help, I’m stuck, but with it, I know that I can
    continue on my path towards healing. Thank you. One thing I have taken away from this ordeal is a consistent
    gratitude practice. Even if I haven’t spoken to you in a while,
    chances are I’m thinking of you often as I consider circumstances,
    experiences, and people for which I am thankful. You’ve taught me the power of compassionate acts, and I hope
    you know that the next time you’re in need I want to be the first
    person you approach for support. Thank you for reading this far and for considering my requests,
    even as there are infinite worthy causes. Please don’t hesitate to
    contact me with questions, comments, poetry, kind words, etc :)

"45,171",Hannah's Heroes,U.S. Dollar,,of $177k goal,722,"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah",https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes

      one is going to take the Village though. Jesse was diagnosed with stage 3 liver cancer several months
      ago and though a successful ablation the cancer was killed, due to
      other illnesses Jesse’s liver does not regenerate. Unfortunately
      she needs a full transplant before the cancer comes back. She is
      currently on the wait list and unable to work. It takes all the
      energy she can muster to spend quality time carrying for her
      beautiful 2 year old daughter Selena. Jesse’s husband Greg is an
      amazing man and has been her rock throughout all of this while
      maintaining all the financial and household responsibilities. Needless to say the medical bills are piling up and becoming
      insurmountable. The Russman’s need help to get over this mountain
      they are about to climb? Cancer is a wicked disease that gives no
      acknowledgement to age or personal circumstance. A liver
      transplant is Jesse's only hope of survival. Jesse and Greg live 90 miles away from the nearest hospital.
      So they have to stay in a hotel with Selena when Jesse has
      treatments.  When Jesse has her transplant she will be in the
      hospital for a month and then it will take 4 to 6 months of
      recovery at home. They will need some in home care for Selena and

"1,520",Help Dylan pay for hernia surgery!,U.S. Dollar,,of $10k goal,10,"Howdy, I’m Dylan. I’m a 23 year old with two jobs working my way through art school. When
    I’m not working, I spend my spare time drawing, watching too many
    movies and quoting Star Wars at every opportunity . Since I hate asking for help myself, a friend offered to write
    something up for me. Thanks for reading. Always in motion is the future. --------------------------- Hi there, I’ve worked with Dylan for a little over a year now.
    He’s hardworking, motivated and always has everyone in tears from
    laughter. It was his drive that led him to get a second job to help
    pay for art school and have some more financial stability. His
    second job was far more physically demanding (he’s a smol boi) but
    he’s not one to let that get in the way. Unfortunately, Dylan recently sustained a pretty serious injury
    - two inguinal hernias - that are in desperate need of surgical
    repair. Due to financial constraints, he’s had to postpone two
    different surgical appointments, as well as pay for several doctor’s
    visits. While he has insurance, it isn’t covering the majority of
    the expenses he’s incurred so it’s had to come out of pocket or be
    put onto credit cards. Two months in, the debt is adding up, the
    problem is getting worse by the day and Dylan is in constant pain -
    physically and mentally. He’s having to miss work across both jobs
    on a regular basis, if not from pain caused by the hernias, because
    of crippling migraines caused by the pain and subsequent stress. Point blank, missing work means he’s not making money. Dylan
    is not someone afraid to work for what he has and what he needs. He
    is in a terrible catch-22, as money is what he desperately needs to
    get the surgery. However, his injuries have made it nearly
    impossible to do so. He has to be cautious doing the simplest tasks
    we all take for granted because every day, as he’s at risk of the
    injury becoming more severe. The doctors have suggested surgical
    repair and recovery time as soon as possible to prevent further injury. Your donations would help Dylan: - cover the initial expenses required for scheduling the
    surgery, including (but not limited to) any pre-op office visits,
    blood work, testing, exams, and covering wages lost due to missing
    work to complete those visits - cover wages lost during the minimum two week recovery time

285,Lydia & Blessing,,,,,"Hi everyone Its not my usual style to reach out to people & friends this way,
  but here I am :-), I have a good reason and I also wanted to highlight
  some of what goes on in some of the government hospitals in South
  Africa these days, its pretty horrific. Lydia and her family have been a part of my family for well over 30
  years. Lydia looks after our home in Magaliesburg, she sees us as her
  family and me as her sister – she is a beautiful and incredibly wise
  old soul for such a young person. She has had a tragic life, through
  no fault of her own, with family members murdered, brother in jail and
  so much more. She has a child of her own, Anna, who is in her teens
  now, and took in a relative’s small child when her mum was killed. But
  she always has a smile on her face, always kind and thoughtful and
  happy, despite everything, wanting to do right by her girls. She unexpectedly got pregnant this year (according to the man, who is
  nowhere to be seen, protection was used), she also has HIV (she was
  told by the man he was not infected, he was). Roughly 8 weeks ago she
  got jaundice and was hospitalised – she was in hospital for 6 weeks
  with no improvement and no real care as far as I can gather. She then had to have an emergency caesarean last week, the baby was
  only 35 weeks. Lydia was left with no pain killers, no food and no water after the
  C-section. My sister in law had to fight the doctors just to see her
  for 2 minutes to take her some food, water, essentials and pain
  killers (having had a C-section herself). I don’t think the doctors wanted her to see the dire state of affairs
  this hospital was in. She was released with a 2kg baby, who wasnt even put into an
  incubator when he was born, and his sucking reflex wasn’t developed
  enough at birth and so couldnt feed. Lydia left with her scar infected
  and a bladder infection and no medication. So all in all, quite a mess. She's being looked after in Joburg with my family, they have taken
  her to doctors and peadeatricians, got her the antibiotics she needs,
  and will be heading back to the farm soon. We are and have been doing
  what we can but this is just the start of this new journey and they'll
  need a bit of extra support. She needs nappies for her baby, clothes, money for doctors’
  appointments and medication, regular transportation for her HIV
  treatment from the farm which is over an hour away and more. So, if you have some spare change lying around, any small amount
  would make a huge difference, making Lydia's life that little bit
  easier putting a smile back on her lovely face, I would be most grateful. Rachel Wilson",https://fundrazr.com/61XeZ9

"17,485",Drew’s leukemia fight,U.S. Dollar,,of $20k goal,153,"Drew Aufderheide was diagnosed with a rare and incurable form of
  Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) .  Only 5,000 per year in the United
  States are diagnosed with this disease and because the cancer is
  caused by a chromosomal change, there is no way to cure it - only
  medication to keep it at bay.  At the age of 33, it is extremely rare
  for someone like Drew to have this form of leukemia.  It is normally
  diagnosed in people with an average age of 67, and the life expectancy
  is approximately 15 years. There are currently a lot of unknown facts
  surrounding Drew's case because physicians and oncologists do not
  often see CML in someone so young and because of Drew's young age, his
  life expectancy is unknown. What is known, is that Drew needs to take a maintenance chemo
  drug/pill each day to manage the CML for the rest of his life, or
  until a cure is discovered.  There are only a few drugs available at
  this time to treat this disease and Drew's body has already rejected
  3.  He is on the last and 4th drug that is available at this time and
  because it is so rare the demand for the drug is low.  The medication
  he is on now comes from Switzerland, the only place it is made.  The
  doctor orders it through a lab in New Jersey, it is then
  mailed directly to Drew. This medication is not available through a pharmacy. Because of the low demand, the cost for Drew's medication is
  approximately $11,000 per/month.  Medical Insurance and grants pay a
  portion of the entire cost of the drug, so Drew is faced with finding
  funding to make up the balance.  This disease has been an incredible
  financial strain on Drew and his wife Val. With this medication comes
  side effects that he must manage.  Drew has met this challenge with
  his usual strength of determination, peace of soul, his faith in God
  and warm and loving demeanor. Drew is very grateful for the prayers and financial support people
  have shown him in the past.  Financially, the importance of any
  monetary gifts cannot be overstated.  It has allowed him to pay for
  the medication to keep him alive.  From a faith viewpoint, he cannot
  thank you all enough for your prayers.  He knows from experience that
  prayer works.  During this last year when weeks of side effects have
  kept him in bed unable to work, he felt your love and prayers.",https://fundrazr.com/exjqd
"34,229",Helping Heidi with Cancer Treatments,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,231,"For those that don’t know me I’m Heidi! For everyone else, Hi! And, if you haven’t heard already, please visit my website at https://peanutbutterandcancer.com/ for the full shebang. For those of you that may not be able to visit the website... Here’s the skinny. I have brain cancer. I know what you’re feeling, shock, me too
    when I first found out. It started when I was in North Carolina visiting my mom who was
    having a benign brain tumor removed on October 18th. (She’s
    recovering great.) While there, I began having some difficulty
    reading, super aggressive vomiting, and ultimately a raging
    headache. This lasted for a couple of days. My Nanny fortuitously
    took me to the ER in our hometown to, at the very least, get some
    fluids. During that visit, the docs did a CT scan which showed
    evidence of pressure on my brain and the team recommended further
    testing. So I flew back to Denver, CO on October 23. Noah (my
    husband) and I went to Porter ER for follow up. An MRI revealed a
    mass in my brain and they suggested immediate surgery. On 10/25 I
    underwent a successful surgery to remove the visible portions of the
    25mm mass and the tissue was sent out for testing. I was released
    from the hospital on 10/28. On November 1st, I found
    out I have the deadliest of all 120 types of brain tumors, Stage 4
    Glioblastoma (GBM). And... about 3 weeks ago we received some exciting news.  I tested
  positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV).  Which means the CVM is
    found in 60% of all GBMs.  It's also found in the stem cells of all
    GBMs.  This gives us reason to think the cause of the cancer could
    be from a virus. Which we are currently treating with antiviral
    medications. So, in a world of medicine that's not quite sure what
    to do with GBMs, this gives us a place to start. So, we got some fighting to do, huh? Here’s what treatment looks like. First I radically changed my diet (bye bye sugar and peanut butter) Then we started taking every supplement under the sun that is
    rumored to have anti-cancer properties. After consulting our naturopathic oncologist and nutritionist,
    we've narrowed down what supplements work for me.  Luckily, I've
    been able to take less pills. Yay! We've done the radiation and the first round of chemo. I'll
    still be doing small doses of chemo for the next 6 months. I’ve also been doing a number of alternative and spiritual
    treatments: sound bath, reiki, acupuncture Soon I’ll be starting Optune. (This is the part where I shave my
  head). You can check it out here if you want more info ... https://www.optune.com/ This is what I'll look like with the Optune on What I need from you. Send positive vibes. If you believe in Quantum Physics, you know
    energy can heal. Forward any contacts or resources you may have surrounding
    successful GBM treatments. Consider a monetary donation. Unfortunately, stupid cancer isn't
    cheap. GBM is like a needy, expensive house guest that doesn't know
    when to leave. If you feel compelled to donate, we appreciate your contribution.",https://fundrazr.com/pbandcancer
"1,250",Help Shannon get out of her house!!!,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.2k goal,12,"Hello! I’m Shannon Flowers from Seattle Washington. Some of you know
  my predicament but maybe you don’t. In 2012, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer. I spent that year
  going through radiation and chemotherapy. As of 2013 I was cancer free. As time went on I developed neuropathy (numbness) in my feet and
  fingers from the chemo I had.  I drop a TON of things and I wobble
  while walking. I’ve developed chronic 24/7 pain in both feet.  I tried
  to go back to my pre-cancer job but with my fingers being numb I
  became a liability. Another side effect started in 2016 in late Fall.  I felt lethargic.
  I was sick all the time. I felt like I had the flu for weeks. After 5
  months of intense tests and soooo much blood drawn we figured out what
  it was. I had SLE, or to non-medical folks, systemic lupus. Lupus is a disease of the immune system. Normally your immune system
  protects the body from infection. With lupus, however, the immune
  system attacks tissues in various parts of the body. I have joint
  pain, we’ve determined that my lupus is starting to affect my kidneys
  and some muscles. I also have extreme fatigue. This paired with
  chronic pain is devastating. I learned of the Alinker bike from an article on how actress Selma
  Blair has one and it helps her MS greatly. I have problems walking with my neuropathy and lupus adds even more
  numbness to my feet and fingers. I stumble often. My fatigue limits my
  activity. I do have a rolling walker to take places but even on a trip
  to get groceries the activity will make me take a 3-5 hour nap when I
  get home. As some of you know, I had the Seattle Geekly podcast with my husband
  and we’d go to a ton of geek conventions. I haven’t been to any
  conventions in the past 3 years. My social life is gone. I have to beg
  off so many family and friend occasions. This will replace my walker
  for inside as well as outside. I’m not in favor of scooters until I
  absolutely have to. This will keep me standing eye to eye with people
  rather than waist high. I believe that if I had the Alinker bike I would be able to attend
  conventions again. You sit on the seat and have your legs move. Since
  one of my needs is breaks to sit every few minutes I really think I
  could get out of the house more with it. I think I’d be able to travel more. I used to really love shopping in
  a mall. My friends or my sister and I would walk around, socialize and
  (sometimes) buy things. I didn’t think it might be a possibility until
  I learned of this. I don’t like the thought of having to get a scooter. It’s confining. i know this is a huge amount to ask. I’m on disability now and
  probably the rest of my life. I can’t have a job so that’s why I’m
  asking for help. This bike looks like freedom to me. My rheumatologist always tells
  his patients to try to get outside and walk. I don’t have enough
  mobility right now to be able to do that right now. So if you can help, please donate so I can be confident and leave the
  house. Possibly see you at a convention soon. I really appreciate it.❤️ BTW- The amount shown I need to raise is the bike + tax Thank you for reading my story!",https://fundrazr.com/e1XWDf
145,Help Eric beat his Birth Defects,U.S. Dollar,,of $13k goal,3,"When I first arrived in Ghana, standing at the airport waiting to be
  picked up, I was terrified. It was my first time out of the US, and I
  wasn’t on a vacation – I was in my new home. What had been excitement
  and hope for the unknown, quickly turned into panic and a fear that I
  had made a grave mistake. I stood there waiting to be picked up,
  falling deeper and deeper into this hole of self-doubt and anxiety.
  And then my driver rolled up, sporting a big, goofy, toothy smile.
  Animated, he practically screamed “Welcome Michael!!!!” Before
  launching my bags into the van. He was introduced as Richard, more
  affectionately known as Uncle Richie. He gave off an air of
  cheerfulness so infectious that the smile on his face immediately
  lifted my heart out of its pool of darkness and reminded me of the
  hope I had felt only hours before. And just like that – the exuberant
  Uncle Richie became my first friend here in Ghana. For my first few
  months here, Uncle Richie drove me anywhere I needed to go, helping me
  understand the town around us, where I could get things, what I would
  need. As I walked around campus trying to familiarize myself with my
  new colleagues, Uncle Richie was always a friendly face that made me
  feel less lonely, and like I belonged. Over the past two years, Uncle
  Richie and I have continued to be close friends, during which I have
  become acquainted with his family. His wife, Beatrice, a talented
  seamstress, also known as the woman wonder that makes all my African
  clothes, and their five children; 3 girls and 2 boys! Their youngest
  son, Eric, is the reason I come to you all today for help. I first met Eric when I was at Beatrice’s shop getting a fitting done
  when her 4 children ran in. In their school uniforms, they were
  running and laughing playing after-school games. There was another
  child sitting on the steps, who I assumed was a random child – until
  Uncle Richie introduced him as his youngest son, Eric. Eric, as I
  could immediately see, was affected with some severe birth defects. He
  had growths on his neck and face, what looked like a deformity on his
  head, and eyes that were not properly developed. Eric was not very
  verbal and did not seem quick to meet new people, hesitant as though
  he was expecting a bad reaction. Uncle Richie explained that he had
  birth defects. They had been trying to fix them, but it was slow
  coming as the money wasn’t there. After speaking further with Uncle
  Richie and Eric’s doctors, it was explained to me that Eric was born
  with Goldenhar syndrome along with other birth defects. The Goldenhar
  syndrome has affected his eyes and general facial appearance, and is
  typically associated with abnormalities of some internal organs such
  as the heart, kidney, lungs, and nervous system. Unfortunately, Uncle
  Richie and his wife aren’t sure how Eric’s internal organs have been
  affected, as they have not been able to afford the tests.
  Additionally, as you can see he is afflicted with an extremely bad
  overgrowth of hyperpigmented wart lesions, as well as a reoccurring
  fungal infection on his head, and recently has been experiencing
  seizures for which the cause is also unknown. These birth defects and medical issues have severely affected the
  quality of life of Eric and his family. Eric has been unable to
  regularly attend school, as he is constantly ridiculed and ostracized
  by the other kids due to his appearance. As a 6 year old kid, I don’t
  need to explain the emotional toll it has taken on him to be treated
  like an exhibit by his peers. Furthermore, Uncle Richie and his wife
  are finding it near impossible to support five children in addition to
  Eric’s medical expenses on a seamstress and taxi driver’s salary. Thus, I would like to ask you all for any support you are able to
  give. Uncle Richie has been a source of support and comfort in my time
  here, and I hope to be able to give back in some way for that. I have
  set the fundraising goal for $20,000, as that will cover a large
  portion of the costs for his future surgeries, as well as some to
  undergo the tests needed to assess his internal organs thoroughly.
  Anything you are willing to give is appreciated, even if the only
  support can offer is to share this campaign! Thank you all for reading <3 Below are some pictures of Eric. All pictures uploaded at the request
  of Uncle Richie.",https://fundrazr.com/81WI3e

  at City of Hope. During the first phase of treatment, a small spot on

    kind of help does not come easy for her. But, we have convinced her
    that relieving some of her financial burden will allow her to focus
    all of her energy on healing. Our goal is to raise funds to cover
    one year of medical and living expenses. We are hoping to raise funds to help her with medical co-pays;
    living expenses; integrative nutrition; ongoing expenses for her
    son, Eli; and complementary therapies that are not covered by insurance. Chris is a precious and inspiring friend to many, a true renaissance

  inviting her friends, fans, and community to support her during this
  challenging time. We want her to know that we are here for her, as she

"34,780",Help Victor Beat MS with Stem Cell Transplantation,Canadian Dollar,,of $40k goal,182,"Hello, We are a group of Victor's family and friends and we are trying to
  help him raise funds to finance a trip overseas, to attend a medical
  centre that specializes in Stem Cell Treatments. The exact centre and
  the exact treatment are yet to be determined.This will depend on the
  amount of funds raised. There are many variables involved in this type
  of treatment, each with their own respective cost. An example would
  be, an Autologous  transplant (collecting a patient's own
  blood-forming stem cells), versus an Allogeneic transplant (collecting
  stem cells from a matching donor). Fortunately, it's a very hopeful
  time for people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis and other
  Auto-Immune diseases. There have been many success stories (some of
  which you can view on YouTube). This type of treatment is becoming
  mainstream in many countries around the world. Sadly for Victor,
  Canada is still in its developmental stage. Please take a moment and read a little bit about Victor's life and
  his battle with MS. If you can financially manage a small donation, it
  would be truly appreciated. A donation can be made right from this
  page. Victor will receive 95% of the funds, and this wonderful website
  will receive 5%. Whether you can donate or not, please be so kind as
  to pass this page along, via email or social media, to as many people
  as you can.  We thank you and are grateful for your support. Most of you visiting this fundraising page already know Victor, but
  for those of you who don't please let me introduce him. Victor is 59
  years old and has been fighting an uphill battle with Multiple
  Sclerosis for 26 years. It has been quite a battle but he has always
  fought with courage and grace.  Victor first felt the symptoms of MS
  shortly after completing his first and only triathlon.  Soon after
  that race, he was eager to begin training in hopes of improving upon
  his time in the next race. It was then that the symptoms hit him, and
  they had an immediate and devastating effect.  He went from running 17
  miles a day to not being able to run one block. In 1984, just after completing college, Victor found employment with
  the CIBC in the Savings Application Department as a Programmer. Two
  years later he transferred to Host Facilities as a Programmer.  His
  talents were recognized  and he was promoted to manage a group of 7
  programmers. His team was the infrastructure and the bank's
  applications ran on their software. Victor was prepared to leave the bank due to his MS in 1999 when the
  logistics of getting to work became difficult, but in the year 2000,
  (potential Y2K crisis) he stayed on to ensure all applications ran
  smoothly. Victor left his managerial position shortly after this
  period and is now supported, in part, by longterm disability benefits. In 2010, Victor, his wife Michelle and his brother Tony, all went to
  Egypt to have the CCSVI (Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency) -
  Liberation treatment.  As you can imagine it was a quite an expensive
  endeavor. The physical benefits Victor experienced were remarkable but
  some affects were short lived. At that point, in 2010, Victor hadn't
  been able to move his right leg for many years. Amazingly, just a few
  hours after doctors placed catheters and balloon inflation into his
  collapsed and blocked veins, Victor was able to raise that same leg
  into the air.  When he returned home we could all see improvement and
  thought he was on his way to recovery.  Even his horrific Trigeminal
  Neuralgia pain was greatly reduced. Trigeminal Neuralgia
    is considered to be one of the most painful afflictions known.
    It is characterized by episodes of excruciating stabbing or
    electrical shock-like pains which hit one side of the face. The
    episodes of pain usually last up to two minutes and may occur
    spontaneously or be triggered by light stimulation. Victor has
    endured this affliction daily for over a decade. The CCSVI results lasted for approximately one year.  We believe the
  vein in his neck collapsed and became blocked once more. Due to the
  delicate nature of veins (as opposed to arteries), stents cannot be
  used. There is a risk of the stent becoming dislodged, migrating along
  the blood vessels and becoming lodged in the heart or lungs. Prior to the MS, Victor lived a very healthy lifestyle and continues
  to do so today. Beginning day one, Victor has not benefitted with any
  traditional medicine for his symptoms. In fact all prescribed options
  to manage pain only exacerbated his leg weakness. Research has since
  determined that as varied as MS symptoms may present so too are the
  outcomes with medication for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.
  To support his wellness, Victor employs various holistic forms. Some
  of the modalities include: Hyperbaric Oxygen treatments; Live Blood
  Cell Analysis; Reichian therapy; Homeopathy; Naturopathic Medicine; as
  well as following a strict diet and supplement regime. The financial
  impact has been staggering, but Victor attributes his longevity to
  these natural treatments. The driving force that gives Victor strength to endure this battle is
  his love for his family; his wife Michelle, daughter Simone, and son
  Kristian. He once stated to me that if he were able to go back in
  time, he would gladly suffer MS again if it meant he could spend his
  life with Michelle, and participate fully with their children while
  they strive to achieve their own personal and professional
  aspirations.  Victor is proud that both Simone and Kristian are
  excelling in university with a shared goal to positively impact
  healthcare for others. In the bottom left-hand corner of the above profile photo, there is a
  link to additional photos. Please feel free to have a glimpse at the
  amazing life Victor has lived, and is living. We, Victor's friends and family, thank you!",https://fundrazr.com/fundvictor
235,Cuddle Bear Book Drive for Medical City Children's in Dallas by Amber & Jacki,U.S. Dollar,,of $350 goal,6,"Everyone Needs A Hug Sometimes! Jaclyn Drexel and I are asking our friends, family, and anyone

      FOUR DAYS!!! We are doing a Cuddle Bear Book Drive to help
    kids receiving treatment at Medical City Children’s of
    Dallas to feel comforted during trying and difficult times.
    This is an important mission to both of us. My younger brother was
    born with cancer and he spent the first couple of months of his life
    in the hospital. My son has had a history of going into breathing
    crises when he was younger, often resulting in hospital stays. It
    was during one of J’s first hospital stays that we met Jacki. She
    was one of his amazing nurses. As a prior pediatrics and oncology
    nurse, she has a HUGE heart for kids struggling with their health.
    We decided that giving cuddly bears and sweet books was one way we
    could give back - with your help of course! Why a Cuddle Bear Books Drive? Usborne Books & More has these amazing book and plush sets
    for babies and kids; the book is all about bringing comfort through
    hugs. When given together as a gift, the plush bears and books help
    to bring those hugs to life! Jacki and I will be accepting monetary
    donations to purchase as many Cuddle Bear sets as possible - our
    goal is 21 sets! Here’s the BEST PART , once we
    raise $250 Usborne Books and More matches our donation at 50%! Each
    book and plush combo costs $25. That means, if you sponsor 2 kids by
    donating $50, an additional set will be donated and 3 kids will get
    these sweet and comforting Cuddle Bears! But wait, THERE’S MORE , on top of the Cuddle
    Bear sets that will be hand delivered to Medical City Children’s
    Hospital to brighten the day of the kids receiving treatment,
    Usborne Books & More will ALSO DONATE 5% of

"1,320",Please help Kelly Helsel is funding her way to freedom,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,5,"My name is Kelly Helsel and I have a rare disease called Autonomic
  disease, It is the computer of your brain that effects all your
  organs, I had a minor heart attack and minor heart surgery, I had
  Chemo and IVIG and nothing has worked.  This disease has no cure nor
  has any treatment just comfort measures.  This disease has left me
  with lupus and gastroporesis.  I was a nurse and that is what I was
  meant to be, but had to go on disability.  I can have drop attacks,
  this is where you pass out for no reason, Also have dysautonomia,
  Pots.  Small and large tissue nueropathy.  I can't go for a walk
  around my block or go into a store, you see I have to sit a lot, 
  every few steps and business don't have chairs sitting around.  Also
  the cement kills my legs, If I go somewhere like Costco I pay for
  weeks due to the floor.  This bike to me is amazing, being able to go
  out of the house!  I am basically home bound, If I go out I have to
  choose my steps carefully, so I could get some little piece of my life
  back.  My mission is to rare awareness of invisible illnesses, I am a
  patient advocate but now can only do house calls I can't make it in a
  hospital, to far to walk.  I work with patients that have invisible
  illnesses and need a ear to listen, someone who gets it, I also teach
  journaling and guided imagery to PTSD patients even veterans.  My life
  has always been about helping others,  But I can't unless by phone
  now.  The dream of being able to go outside and go around the block is
  huge, something some people will take for granite.  Making a
  difference in someones life is my life but this bike could help me
  help even more people and this bike could help others as well.  Please
  help me help others.",https://fundrazr.com/11W4S4
"3,543",Mama Rose needs Hyperbaric Therapy.,U.S. Dollar,,of $6k goal,30,"In October 2017, Rose Rios suffered from a stroke leaving her
  immobile and incapable of caring for herself. The results of the
  stroke caused Complex Regional Syndrome, Vascular Dementia, Aphasia
  and have severely shifted her life activities. Rose’s family is unable to fully provide the financial assistance to
  help her receive the care needed to get better, heal and get back the
  fun, vibrant colorful life she lived & felt just a year ago. Rose is surrounded by many friends and family who help take care of
  her around the clock but unfortunately with climbing medical bills
  from physical therapy, doctor’s visits, and the medication needed 2
  times a day- it’s getting more and more difficult. Update on Rose Rios 4.29.19 Rose was hospitalized 2 months ago & has digressed a bit, but is
  still stable. Her everyday routine continues to be a struggle with her
  waking up, using the restroom, eating, taking medicine and traveling
  to appointments. After seeing many specialist, they have concluded that hyperbaric
  oxygen treatments will help with her health and prolong her life. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves breathing pure oxygen in a
  pressurized tube. The Hyperbaric chamber is used to treat stroke
  victims with significant results. The price for this is $1,920/mo, including an oxygen mask, plus a
  lift fee to place her in the chamber. The doctors would like to do
  this for 2-3months, to see if it substantially improves her recovery. Any donations, advice or help is truly appreciated to help us as we
  grasp for ways to help alleviate any amount of suffering and obstacles
  for Rose.",https://fundrazr.com/MamaRiosfundrazr.com
554,The Big Sunflower Project,Pound Sterling,,of £1k goal,62,"The Big Sunflower Project has given away sunflower seeds since 2011
  to raise awareness of the rare neuromuscular condtions known as
  centronuclear and myotubular myopathy. The project aims to get as many people as possible growing
  sunflowers each year, with seeds now being sent to schools and
  nurseries, community groups, groups who work with disadvantaged
  people, hospices and youth groups to name a few, so as well as raising
  awareness of centronuclear and myotubular myopathy, the project
  supports the activities of these groups too. Further information about The Big Sunflower Project can be found below. About the project: https://thebigsunflowerproject.wordpress.com/ How it all began: https://thebigsunflowerproject.wordpress.com/how-it-all-began/ The Big Sunflower Project on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/406061643077357/ A review of The Big Sunflower Project 2018 https://thebigsunflowerproject.com/centronuclear-and-myotubular-myopathy/http://centronuclear.org.uk/theinformationpoint/newsletters/2017/2017-02/the-big-sunflower-project.html The project does not charge for seeds or postage but admin costs for
  the project are high and FundRazer is used to allow those who would
  like to make a donation to do so. In 2019 the cost of sunflower seeds came to £144.40, the cost of
  the second class large stamp which is required to post the seeds is
  79p (£294.94 was spent on postage in total) and the cost of envelopes
  was £22.35. Donations can be for as little as £1, so if you like what we do or

"2,900",Help Amylee to keep moving forward,Canadian Dollar,,of $2.8k goal,12,"Hi my name is Amylee. I'm 35 year old mother of two & wife. I
  also live with Multiple Sclerosis (10 years) which has caused
  epilepsy. Both of those cause me to have difficulty walking and cause
  extreme fatigue. I would really like to get an Alinker so I can feel
  like a functioning productive person again. So I can go on walks with
  my family, do my groceries myself, leave the house alone for the first
  time (I might be reaching but I can hope right? ). All funds raised
  will go to purchasing the Alinker. Please donate. Any amount can help
  me. Thank you for any and all help you can provide. I appreciate it
  immensely & so does my family. - Amylee",https://fundrazr.com/Amylee2215
"3,311",Judy Gerdis Needs Costly Oral Chemo for Metastatic Breast Cancer,U.S. Dollar,,of $9k goal,37,"Hello, I am Tom and Judy Gerdis’ daughter, Trina Sutherland.
     Some of you may be aware in April of this year my mother, Judy, was
    told by her physicians that the breast cancer she fought hard to rid
    her body of in 2008 through 2009 has returned and is attacking her
    bones.  It is currently on a femur, in her tailbone,  shoulder,
    neck, some parts of the spine, and her lower skull. We were excited
    to learn through scans none of her organs have been affected. And we
    want to keep it that way! She began a 10 day treatment of radiation two weeks ago. Now she is
  waiting for her white blood cell count to recover so she may begin the
  oral chemo treatment called Ibrance. Ibrance is a very costly
  prescription. After insurance, it costs $2235.00 for a 21 day supply.
  This prescription could possibly need to be administered for the next
  year. I hope that we can all rally around my parents at this time so
  they will not have to refinance their home in order to pay for this
  lifesaving medicine. The cost of this one drug for a year is  close to
  $30,000. The first month is covered and then we have 30 days to band
  together before the bills hit for each new month’s prescription.  This
  is not including her other medications and treatments. My mom is determined to win this battle once more. Tom and Judy are
  confident the Lord is walking her through this journey  and the
  Father’s amazing healing works will be demonstrated mightily. Thank you for your donations and prayers! Every little bit will help
  my mom continue to fight the good fight. Please follow this page at
  the bottom to keep up with updates. If Ibrance is discontinued,
   whatever monies are raised will go to any other medical expenses my
  parents may incur.   Blessings!",https://fundrazr.com/f1VFVf
"1,505",We Support Nancy- Mental Health Funds,U.S. Dollar,,of $3k goal,13,"Nancy is an incredible activist, fighting for immigration
    justice, abortion access, and always speaking out for her community.
    She is also a survivor. The abuse she endured at the hands of an
    immigration organizer led to her hospitalization for suicide. She
    has been incredibly brave by sharing her story, including in the Austin Chronicle . After going public with the abuse, her abuser continued his
    controlling and abusive behavior by bringing a defamation suit
    against her. In the court documents, he made public parts of Nancy's
    story that were her right to share, not his. We believe Nancy. We
    support her. We love her. We are asking for help covering her legal
    costs so that she can keep sharing her story, on her terms, with our
    support behind her. Forcing Nancy to take on the cost of a lawsuit is an abuse tactic we
  cannot let her face alone. While it's unclear what the final legal
  costs will be, additional money raised will go to support the costs
  Nancy has accrued in the past several months securing her safety and
  well-being from her abuser. All funds raised go directly to Nancy. Court has been scheduled for May 29th. Legal funds are still needed
  to cover preparation and in the unfortunate case that this case
  continues. Our sincere hope is that this fundraiser will no longer be
  needed, but we'll have more information as Nancy heads to court to
  face her abuser. *credit for this beautiful illustration of our friend Nancy goes to
  Yunuén Sigler* **UPDATE** I won my legal case against my abuser. He was not able to silence me.
  Although my legal fees are over, there was still an incredible dent to
  my finances during this entire process and trying to attain mental
  health services has cost quite a bit. In order to continue accessing
  these services and the care I need for PTSD because of the case, I
  need assistance once again and I hope y'all can help me. Being
  incredibly vulnerable with my financial status and my mental health is
  not easy but I share this with y'all because I will not be silenced.",https://fundrazr.com/WeSupportNancy
